# Billager-Bot
Billager Bot is a Discord Bot built using the discord.py library. Designed for use in a specific server for my friends and I, but feel free to use and modify it if you want to. Runs on Python 3.9 with a handful of dependencies for certain features. I wrote this bot to learn more about Python and to create something fun that would provide entertainment and utility for my friends and I. Should work for the most part.

## Features
BBot offers a nice collection of rudimentary features including the following:
### Lore
You know how you always have that one friend who keeps a "quote note" in their phone for wacky out-of-context stuff people say? This is a more refined system of that concept. Add, edit, and eliminate "lore" - formatted embed messages - to keep an ongoing record of what's been going on or notable events.

### Score
Not to be misconstrued with any form of a social credit system, this score-keeping function allows for a simple way of rewarding or punishing other users for their actions. Mostly used as +1 for good jokes, -1 for bad jokes. A scoreboard can be viewed at any time. Every Friday evening a callout post is made that publicly shames the user with the lowest score. The scoreboard resets monthly.

### Voice
There is a handful of audio clips which can be played on command. No music streaming ability because I considered it unnecessary for the scope of this bot.

### BBux ᘋ
A crude form of a currency system. Users can earn ᘋ through a few mini-games and spend them on prizes. Imagined in my head as a kind of arcade ticket system.

## Roadmap
I intend to continue development of BBot in my spare time for the foreseeable future. I have a handful of ideas for things to add and improve upon.
These include but are not limited to:
- Migrating from a shelve file read/write system to something for refined like SQLite
- More BBux minigames (Blackjack?) and prizes (trading cards?)
- Enhancing the prize system with more flavor  
- A potential TTS system for the voice client
- A more modular approach to permissions are outputs to make the bot potentially viable for public use
- Expanding output text and messages with more variety
- A "starboard" kind of soft pin system like in the Discord.py Discord server
- Probably other things I don't remember at the time of writing this
